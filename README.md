# Library Project

This Library project is a simple application that allows users to manage their book collection. Users can input details such as title, author, page count, and whether they have read the book or not. The project is structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance code organization and reusability.

## Features

- **Add Book:** Users can add new books to their library by providing information like title, author, page count, and reading status.

- **Remove Book:** Users have the ability to remove a book from their library, keeping their collection up to date.

- **Toggle Read Status:** Users can mark books as read or unread, helping them keep track of their reading progress.

## Usage
To use the Library project, simply visit the online version available at [Library App](https://your-library-app-url.com). Start managing your book collection without the need to clone the repository to your local machine.

For any additional features or improvements, feel free to contribute ideas or submit issues.

Happy reading!

## Code Structure

The project is organized using Object-Oriented Programming principles with the following file structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the project.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the application (additional styling can be added).
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the OOP structure and functionality for the Library.

## Future Enhancements

In future updates, we plan to add the following features:

- User authentication to save individual libraries.
- Sorting and filtering options for better organization.
- Improved styling for a more visually appealing interface.

Feel free to contribute ideas or submit issues for potential improvements.

Happy reading!
